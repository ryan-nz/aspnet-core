## Some key points to complete this project
- PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND USE THE LATEST VERSION 1.2.6 OF REDIS COMPONENT FOR C# DEVELOPVER IN VS2017 (at the time of writting on 27 November 2017).
- VS2017 has the built-in REDIS 1.2.4 for C# which is duplicated with 1.2.6, there could be some bugs that make build failed.
